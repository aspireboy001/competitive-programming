You need to find where stdc++.h header file is present, so open the terminal and use the command:

find /usr/include -name 'stdc++.h'

Output:

/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/11/bits/stdc++.h

Go to the above location and open the terminal there and now we are ready to precompile bits/stdc++.h header file.

Use the following command:

sudo g++ -std=c++17 stdc++.h

You'll observe stdc++.h.gch file is now created implying that precompiling is done.
